    <h1 class="InfoHeader">Summary</h1>
    This page is an attempt to record most finished community made ships, military or otherwise, in a website. It's currently (and always will be) very WIP. If you believe your ship should be in here, add it (send me a PR on github) or send me a message! If I didn't find a name for your ship, add that too or send me a message on discord (IHaveNoLife#6972). I also sometimes infer names or confuse ships, which means I sometimes get them wrong. Send me a message on discord or edit it if you see a mistake.

    <h1 class="InfoHeader"> Why was the page moved? </h1>
    The page had 83 images, and due to how MediaWiki (which the Starbase wiki uses) works that meant it sent a seperate HTTP request for every single one. It was bad for server performance.

    <h1 class="InfoHeader">Editing method</h1>
    In order to stop this page being an advertisement for the first 100-200 ships, please add new ships to the <font color="orangered"><b>top</b></font> of the page, just under this section. This should keep the top 100 rotating over time. As for where to find ships to add to this page, I use Kenetor and Okim's discord servers as well as the main server and "Starbase Engineering Conference."

    <img class="Shipimage" src="WikiImages/Cherax.jpg"> <br />

    A fairly large hauler in a horseshoe design. It has two fixed mount autocannons and one turreted autocannon. It's an adaption from a ship in dual universe and took about a week to design. It has buttons to open and close doors and 64 ore crates. There are cargo locks but they don't work because they only come from two directions.
