    <h1 class="InfoHeader">Summary</h1>
    This page is an attempt to record most finished community made ships, military or otherwise, in a website. It's currently (and always will be) very WIP. If you believe your ship should be in here, add it (send me a PR on github) or send me a message! If I didn't find a name for your ship, add that too or send me a message on discord (IHaveNoLife#6972). I also sometimes infer names or confuse ships, which means I sometimes get them wrong. Send me a message on discord or edit it if you see a mistake or you don't want your ship here.

    <h1 class="InfoHeader"> Why was the page moved? </h1>
    The page had 83 images, and due to how MediaWiki (which the Starbase wiki uses) works that meant it sent a seperate HTTP request for every single one. It was bad for server performance.

    <h1 class="InfoHeader">Editing method</h1>
    In order to stop this page being an advertisement for the first 100-200 ships, please add new ships to the <font color="orangered"><b>top</b></font> of the page, just under this section. This should keep the top 100 rotating over time. As for where to find ships to add to this page, I use Kenetor and Okim's discord servers as well as the main server and "Starbase Engineering Conference."

            A simple 4 crate hauler running purely on batteries and propelled by manoeuvring thrusters. It is designed to be an affordable mining ship to help acquire funds for a larger one.

            It has no brakes or strafe, with manoeuvring done by the rear thruster array and roll by dedicated thrusters. The ship's structure is both simple and sturdy. It has 10 batteries to provide enough flight time to reach both outposts and a speed of 80m/s means you can get there in 18-22 minutes. Going deeper into the belt might not be profitable due to the low capacity and battery dependency.

        <img class="Shipimage" src="WikiImages/resized/Mule.jpg"> <br /><p class="description">

            The Mule IIC is a multipurpose shuttle designed around its cargo lock frames. It can carry various ship parts, supplies, chunks of asteroids, or up to 54 tightly packed ore stacks. It has side mounted guides to make it easier to cram ores in and 4 resource bridges to make mining easier. It has lots of hardpoints for additional thrusters, resource bridges, tools, and weapons and an ISAN navigation system. It moves at between 70-48m/s depending on how much it's hauling and comes with the following electronics:
            <ul>
                <li class="bullet">Turtle, which lowers speed to 10% for manoeuvring.</li>
                <li class="bullet">Cruise, which toggles centering on the main thrust lever.</li>
                <li class="bullet">AutoPower, which monitors power consumption and adjusts generator output accordingly.</li>
                <li class="bullet">AutoTank, which turns off unused fuel tanks.</li>
                <li class="bullet">Alerts, which alerts when power, coolant, and propellant reach critical levels.</li>
            </ul>

            It has 6 box thrusters, two generators with both coolant and radiator support, a receiver, yolol stacks, 4 small tanks, and 6 batteries. It's also been accepted to the ship shop!

            A large 250 crate heavy freighter designed for group mining or bulk freighting. It has 36 thrusters, propelling it to 80m/s, and was adapted from the "Moonfish" explorer. It contains 8 1+2 enhanced generators, 4 double radiators, 8 extra fuel rods, 3 seats, 4 resource ports, 8 batteries, 2 receivers (ISAN mono and signal), and some custom electronics. These electronics include a "turtle" mode that cuts thrust to 10% thrust in stations, "cruise" that enables and disables thrust lever centering, "AutoPower" that adjusts generators to only output what is required, "AutoTank" which turns off unused tanks, and "Alerts", which alerts when power, coolant, and propellant reach critical levels.

They use the same chassis (1 small generator, 6 box thrusters, 2 small propellant tanks, 2 resource ports, 2 seats and ISAN.) They come in 3 variants that differ in the amount of cargo containers (24-48-72) and speed changes due to the weight. All 3 have a hardpoint at the bottom for basic armaments and mining tools and can perform up/down strafing but no left/right strafe. There is a video showing them off at https://yadi.sk/d/9kzHGrYlqxqsYA . Additionally, they all have an ISAN mono coordinate system, power and propellant management chips, and turtle and cruise movement assistants.
